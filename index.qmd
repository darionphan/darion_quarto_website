Hi! I'm Darion Phan and this is my website. I'm planning to pursue a PhD in economics. I am a Math/Econ and Stats double major at UCLA.

In this website you will find some of my projects, my contact information, and my resume.

I had to create this website for a class, but I had a fun time making everything! Feel free to explore using the NavBar in the top left! My resume and contact information can be found below.
